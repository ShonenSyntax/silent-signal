**Anonymous AI-Powered Campus Issue Reporting Platform**

Silent Signal is a privacy-first web application that enables students to report sensitive campus issues anonymously. Using AI, the system analyzes reports to extract meaningful insights, helping institutions identify recurring problems and take informed action without compromising student safety or identity.

## 🚀 Problem Statement

**Many students hesitate to report campus issues such as:**

- Harassment or ragging
- Safety concerns
- Infrastructure problems
- Academic grievances

This hesitation is often caused by fear of retaliation, social pressure and lack in traditional reportin systems.

### As a result, critical issues remain underreported and unresolved.

**Silent Signal removes identity from the reporting process entirely.**

- No login required

- No personal data collected

- Reports are analyzed using AI to detect patterns

- Admins see issues, not people

### This encourages honest reporting while still providing actionable insights.

## 🧠 Key Features

- 🔒 100% Anonymous Reporting

- 🤖 AI-based Issue Analysis (Gemini API)

- 🧾 Automatic Categorization & Severity Scoring

- 📊 Admin Dashboard for Insights

- ☁️ Cloud-backed Storage using Firebase Firestore

- 🌐 Simple Web Interface

## 🤖 AI Workflow

1. User submits an anonymous report

2. Backend sends report text to Gemini

3. Gemini returns:

    - Summary

    - Category

    - Severity score

4. Parsed result is stored in Firestore

5. Admin dashboard displays structured insights

## 🖥️ Admin Dashboard

**The admin interface allows authorized viewers to:**

- View all submitted reports

- See AI-generated summaries

- Identify issue categories

Prioritize issues based on severity

> ⚠️ Note: The admin dashboard is intentionally kept separate from user submission flow to preserve anonymity.
